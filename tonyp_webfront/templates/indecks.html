        <p class="font-weight-light"><h3>About Me</h3></p>
        <p> I am the husband to an amazing wife and the father of two amazing kiddoes, who luckily get their looks from mama.
            I have a passion for solving problems with technology and using automation to create and increase capability.
            Although my <a href="https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/cyber-transport-systems"> Air Force career field
                (Cyber Transport Systems) is focused on network engineering</a>, my thirst for knowledge and self initiative
            enabled me to understand, implement, and architect solutions spanning the full stack
            on a global scale. My obsession with constant improvement allowed me to drive significant improvements to the way
            the United States Air Force trains new IT recruits. My breadth and depth of technical expertise enabled me to
            revolutionize how the U.S. special operations communications community builds, deploys, monitors, and automates
            service delivery to our users. In addition, by leveraging my 23 years in ITOps and vast professional network,
            I have been able to drive a digital transformation in my organization and spark the same in others.
            Finally, I love learning new things and sharing my knowledge and experience with those around me.
