        <p class="font-weight-light"><h3>About Me</h3></p>
        <p> I am the husband to an amazing wife and the father of two amazing kiddoes, who luckily get their looks from mama.
            I have a passion for solving problems with technology and using automation to create and increase capability.
            Although my <a href="https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/cyber-transport-systems"> Air Force career field
                (Cyber Transport Systems) is focused on network engineering</a>, my thirst for knowledge and self initiative
            enabled me to understand, implement, and architect solutions spanning the full stack
            on a global scale. My obsession with constant improvement allowed me to drive significant improvements to the way
            the United States Air Force trains new IT recruits. My breadth and depth of technical expertise enabled me to
            revolutionize how the U.S. special operations communications community builds, deploys, monitors, and automates
            service delivery to our users. In addition, by leveraging my 23 years in ITOps and vast professional network,
            I have been able to drive a digital transformation in my organization and spark the same in others.
            Finally, I love learning new things and sharing my knowledge and experience with those around me.

            <div class="container">
                This website is not a wordpress representation
                of my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/tonypnode/">linked in profile</a> and resume. It does have a
                quick view of my previous roles and a list of skills and whatnot and if that's what you're here for
                keep on scrolling, you'll see it. This site IS however, much more than that. I thought it would be
                beneficial (and a whole lot of fun for me) to provide an actual live demonstration of some of my
                capabilities. The entire website and all the things directly and indirectly related is just that.
                <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Front end</li>
                    <li>Backend</li>
                    <li>Security Analysis</li>
                    <li>Data Analytics</li>
                    <li>CI/CD Pipeline</li>
                    <li>Database</li>
                    <li>Provisioning Automation</li>
                    <li>Configuration Management Automation</li>
                    <li>Service Level Indicators (SLIs)/Service Level Objectives (SLOs)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This site is built in AWS. I could have done a static site generator like
                    <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a> or <a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde">
                    Hyde</a>, and AWS S3, but that wouldn't have been much fun. To be useful and fun for me, I chose
                    Python and Django. Flask would have been just as fun, however, I chose Django because I wanted the "batteries
                    included". The project is still too early on to know exactly how I want it to look. As I continue
                    to develop, I will add more. For instance, while I was typing this up, I realized I don't have
                    Lambda functions running and would like to include that. I added issue #21 to
                    <a href="https://github.com/tonypnode/portfolio_site/projects/1"> the Kanban board in the github</a>
                    I'm using to develop the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire project is being developed via Test Driven Development (TDD). I commit and run
                    my tests locally. Once I push to github (usually to a feature branch, unless it's just html),
                    it runs through <a href="https://travis-ci.org/tonypnode/portfolio_site">Travis CI</a>, where
                    I'm testing for python 3.6 and 3.7.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also the security and analytics side. I have a few features you can take a look at in the
                    project board, but, I'm dropping my ALB logs into S3 and then scraping them with my demo version of Splunk.
                    I have built out a dashboard to track a few things:
                <ul>
                    <li>Number of unique visitors</li>
                    <li>Their location</li>
                    <li>Service Level Objective</li>
                    <li>Not-so-normal Calls to the website
                        <ul><li>I use this data to block them from getting anything</li></ul></li>
                </ul>
                    As I continue to work through the project, I will probably add more features. I also created a Splunk app
                to that integrates with <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com">pushbullet</a>, so I can get a daily push notifications of
                unique visitors to the site and immediate alerts of any significant "non-normal" activity.

                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see where I'm at with the whole project on the Kanban board. There is still a lot to be done.
                    To be honest, I'm probably just procrastinating finishing my resume. :P
